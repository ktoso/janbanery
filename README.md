<a href="https://kanbanery.com/">Kanbanery</a> is a web app for managing your projects Kanban Style (somewhat similiar to SCRUM, but less restrictive and strict).
Kanbanery has an web interface, as well as a iPad and iPhone version. The RESTful API is open so anyone can write his
favourite tool to be integrated with it - and that's what I'm doing. This connector will be used in the upcomming Intellij
IDEA plugin as well as the Android version of the app.
